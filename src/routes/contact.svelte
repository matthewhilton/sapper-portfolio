    <Heading title={"About Me"} />
    <p>I love making things and doing stuff such as programming microcontrollers (Arduino, teensy, ESP), setting up automation projects (Raspberry Pi) and even making websites (NodeJS, React, Svelte).</p><p>When I find a problem, I learn how to solve it and have fun along the way.</p>

    <p>I also enjoy sculpture art, which usually involves some sort of interactive component using microcontrollers or different lighting effects.</p>

    <p>I am currently studing a <b>Bachelor of IT (Computer Science)</b> at the <b>Queensland University of Technology (QUT)</b>, in my 3rd and final year.</p>
    <p> My areas of study at university are on mobile applications and artificial intelligence. </p>

    <Heading title={"Skills and Experience"} />
    <SubHeading title={"Languages"} />
    <p> I am in the process of learning üá≥üá¥ Norweigan, and would say I am on level A2. I can have basic conversations and watch Norweigan TV (with subtitles) and read simple articles easily. 
        Due to the similarity to Norweigan, I often can also read articles in Swedish and Danish which is pretty cool.</p>
        <p>I'm mostly just learning it for fun in my spare time (not taking any classes or anything like that). Once I become proficient in Norweigan I hope to also learn German (a bit more of a complex language). </p>
    <p>Norsk: Jeg l√¶rer norsk og kan forst√• noen norsk. Jeg kan lese enkelt enkle artikler. Jeg kan ofte lese artikler p√• svensk og dansk ogs√•. Jeg l√¶rer det bare for moro i fritiden min. </p>
    <SubHeading title={"Programming"} />
    <p> While I have used many languages in the past, I mostly focus my time on my web development skills. Obviously this means I know <b>Javascript</b> very well, having used the <b>React</b> framework extensively. I have started also learning about <b>Svelte</b> (the framework that built this site!). </p>
    <p> Other languages I am familiar with include: Python, C#, Java, Matlab, React Native, and C.</p>
    <SubHeading title={"Electronics"} />
    <p> I have lots of experience with the <b>Arduino</b> ecosystem, including producing my own custom designed printed circuit boards. Most of my electronics projects involve lighting, wifi, sensors, etc. </p>
    <SubHeading title={"Fabrication"} />
    <p> Experience with 3D printing, CNC machining and woodwork </p>
